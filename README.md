potential sayre high community connection documentation website!


* content that I don't have yet:
    * paragraph about important grants
    * student wellness built out
    * other admin resources that aren't grants???
    * photos for grants

* landing aka guest page 
    * quick links page needs to be created and linked to

* student page
    * resources in directory are formatted so no awkward margins, etc
    * landing page explains post-secondary readiness categories: what that is
    * checkboxes do not work
    * landing page needs to link to the correct sections of the student resources directory
    * search bar needs to work
    * add calendar
    * add student quick links
    Not necessary but they get progressively wilder
    * wildest dream: get filter colors to change AS you scroll
    * wildest dream: a list items in data are actually represented as lists
    * wildest dream: a map
    * wildest dream: checkboxes are reformatted to circles
    
*grant page
    * grant directory - have photos OR just make blank
    * look through data
    * tags/filters for imperative grants
    * header bar needs to be differentiated from anchors for grant types

* about us 
   * get photos to appear
   * personally stylize whole thing 

* general, throughout site
    * should I have a quick links section?
    * remove links that go nowhere or have text that says 'this feature will be coming soon!'
    * both landscape and portrait styling is consistent
        * for directories, static pages have nothing lying overtop them
    * visual icon for each box
    * passes all accessibity checks
        * have "image description" col in all data so looped data has alt img text to pass thru
    * option to increase font size
    * google server to change language if needed
