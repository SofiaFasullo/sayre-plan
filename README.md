potential sayre high community connection documentation website!

to do:

MOST IMPERATIVE:
- content is all included or a message tells that it's coming soon or it is removed
    - all of admin, quick links, student wellness, contact
- navigation tools work or are removed
- all links correct, titles consistent
- about us photos or a link to the sayre site

* content that I don't have yet:
    * paragraph about important grants
    * student wellness
    * other admin resources that aren't grants???

* landing aka guest page 
    * quick links page needs to be created and linked to
    * contact page needs to be created and linked to

* student page
    * resources in directory are formatted so no awkward margins, etc
    * landing page explains post-secondary readiness categories: what that is
    * checkboxes do not work
    * landing page needs to link to the correct sections of the student resources directory
    * search bar needs to work
    * add calendar
    * add student quick links
    Not necessary but they get progressively wilder
    * wildest dream: get filter colors to change AS you scroll
    * wildest dream: a list items in data are actually represented as lists
    * wildest dream: a map
    * wildest dream: checkboxes are reformatted to circles
    
*grant page
    * design all needed content: important grants, links to application help
    * grant directory - have photos OR just make blank
    * absorb top-3-grants into application help & directory
    * look through data
    * make calendar JUST grant cal
    * tags/filters for imperative grants AND for admin/teacher focus
    * header bar names need to be uniform
    * header bar needs to be differentiated from anchors for grant types

* about us 
   * get photos to appear
   * personally stylize whole thing 

* general, throughout site
    * change "admin resources" to "grant resources"
    * remove links that go nowhere or have text that says 'this feature will be coming soon!'
    * both landscape and portrait styling is consistent
        * for directories, static pages have nothing lying overtop them
    * visual icon for each box
    * passes all accessibity checks
        * have "image description" col in all data so looped data has alt img text to pass thru
    * option to increase font size
    * google server to change language if needed
